# E-commerce-Website-Using-Django
I have made a sample Django project of a working ecommerce website with a customer side and a merchant side, where a merchant can add their product on the website and customers can purchase them.

To install this you need to install dbSQlite browser to see your data. And after installing this you should create an another folder to keep this folder and in the same folder create a virtual environment and activate that. Run this in cmd (if not familier with this please refer to any yt video) C:/User//Ecom/E-COmmerce/venv/Scripts> activate

venv - virtual environment name Ecom - new folder name

After that move to - C:/User//Ecom> pip install django

Install Django since this is a new project

after that run this code so that the databse is connected to the project- C:/User//Ecom/E-commerce> py manage.py makemigrations C:/User//Ecom/E-commerce> py manage.py migrate

after that runserver C:/User//Ecom/E-commerce> py manage.py runserver

After that check the server is running and if some models are not installed then install them first and then start the server again.

Thank You - Avilash
